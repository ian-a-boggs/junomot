# Silence, Earthling!

George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Lorraine. Yeah. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. God dammit, I'm late. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Doc.

Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Oh. Whoa, wait, Doc. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?
