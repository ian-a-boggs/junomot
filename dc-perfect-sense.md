title: "Perfect Sense"
---

## Part one

Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Did you hurt your head? Leave me alone. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

## Part Two

Well, they're bigger than me. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Nothing's coming to my mind. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.

Sit here, Marty. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. I've gotta go. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Ahh. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. It's about the future, isn't it?

No. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Nothing.

Good morning, Mom. Who, who? Yeah. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Lorraine. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.
