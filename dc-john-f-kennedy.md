### Who the hell is John F Kennedy?

Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. You'll find out. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

Doc. Marty, why are you so nervous? Where's Einstein, is he with you? And he could sleep in my room. Who is that guy.

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Ohh, no. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Sit here, Marty. Oh, yeah, yeah.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
